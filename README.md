# ZeroDivisionError in Python Function
This repo demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`. The `bug.py` file contains a function that attempts to divide by zero, resulting in the error. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution to handle this error gracefully.

## Bug
The `function` in `bug.py` does not handle the case where `b` is zero, leading to a `ZeroDivisionError`.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to improve the function to prevent the error using a try-except block.
